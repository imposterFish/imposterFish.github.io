        <h1>Hi. My name is Abby and I would like a job.</h1>
        <p>I think that it's a fair assumption that if you are reading this, you have already read my resume. I think that my resume is boring, and that a single page of paper will not give you a fraction of a picture of who exactly I am.</p>
        <p>Instead I will be experimenting to figure out a better way to represent myself. I applogise for the roughness.</p>

<p>Not to sound too desperate, but I've been in search for a job since March 2021. I am glad that my parents can tolerate my lack of employment, but they seem to tolerate it more than most entry level jobs.</p>
<p>I have been told that I am a creative person (by more than just my mom)</p>
