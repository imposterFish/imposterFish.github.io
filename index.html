        <h1>Hi. My name is Abby and I would like a job.</h1>
        <p>If you are reading this, you have probably already read my Resume. If you have not read my resume, let me introduce myself below.</p>
        <p>Hi! I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in May with a BS in Computer Science. Now I am looking for a job. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I find embedded development, security, backend development, fullstack development, computer networks and data analytics interesting. I also really like open source software.</p>
        <p>A key trait of mine is my creativity. I am a creative problem solver, and it is very apparent in my code. I have had professors and interviewers remark on my creative approaches and solutions to problems. I also have leadership and mentoring experience. Once I am a well established professional, I would like to lead and mentor others.</p>
